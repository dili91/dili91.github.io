<p>My name is Andrea, and Iâ€™m a senior software engineer at <a href="https://truelayer.com">TrueLayer</a>.</p>
<p>I spent the majority of my career as a backend engineer, with a focus on designing and building APIs, especially in the <em>payments</em> area.
I've also matured interests and skills in the DevOps/EngOps fields, and I'm familiar with cloud providers, AWS in particular. </p>
<p>I have a solid background in delivering backend solutions, in the context of distributed systems and microservices, 
usually built on top of Java, Rust and .NET stacks. 
I'm used to work with cloud native applications released on Kubernetes or similar cloud based orchestration systems. I'm CKAD certified and an AWS Certified Solutions Architect (associate).</p>
<p>I occasionally work as consultant for small startups and sometimes contribute to <a href="https://github.com/dili91?tab=repositories">open source projects</a>.</p>
<p>A few months ago I started writing my <a href="https://adilisio.com/./posts">blog</a>, which I use to share fun facts about what I do or just as an excuse for learning something new.</p>

Then I moved to product development and I was one of the first members of our <em>Recurring Payments</em> team, whose mission is to abstract the complexities of OpenBanking VRP, BACS Direct Debit and SEPA Direct Debit into a single <a href="https://truelayer.com/vrp/">recurring payments</a> solution. 
Since January 2023 I moved to a customer onboarding product called <a href="https://truelayer.com/signup-plus/">Signup+</a>.
As an extra activity, I'm the main contributor of our official <a href="https://github.com/TrueLayer/truelayer-java">Java client library for payments</a>.</p>
<p>Focus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure migration and optimizations</li>
<li>Public facing or internal API design and implementation: REST, gRPC, GraphQL</li>
<li>Operational excellence: On-call rota shift and practices setup/review, SLO based alerts</li>

<p>At the time I joined the engineering group was focussed on getting a new payments API live. I joined full-time a DevOps team which was responsible for automating end to end and UI tests on physical mobile devices involved in carrier billing products, connected to servers located in diverse geographic areas. This testing was critical to gain confinde
For a limited time, I also contributed to the main payments product team and supported the go live operations required for a new version of the main payments API.</p>
<p>Focus:</p>
